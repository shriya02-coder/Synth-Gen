## Introduction
In the realm of financial data analysis, challenges such as inadequate data quality, limited scope, and inherent biases severely restrict the development of robust predictive models. Our project addresses these issues by generating synthetic financial data that offers a wider scope and greater diversity, thus enhancing predictive modeling capabilities and ensuring a higher degree of data integrity.

## Motivation
This project is driven by the urgent need to overcome the limitations of current financial datasets. With synthetic data that is representative of real-world financial scenarios, we aim to provide a solution to the scarcity and biases present in existing datasets. This will facilitate more accurate and effective financial analysis and modeling.

## Objective
The objective of this research is to generate synthetic financial data that accurately represents the dynamism of financial markets, using an innovative method that blends evolutionary biology principles with deep learning techniques.

## Methodology
We propose a unique methodology that incorporates BERT embeddings for sentence representation, GAN for synthetic data generation, and coalescent theory from evolutionary biology to ensure data diversity and integrity. The process involves several phases, including data representation, clustering of embeddings, evolutionary synthesis, and adversarial training.
